                <h2 class="h2-box">Ethical Decisions related to my Core Values</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">When I came back to New Zealand, I still continue to work remotely from home for few months which is unusual for our company during that time (pre-pandemic period). The ethical decision I made was to work honestly without being monitored and to be accountable for the works that was expected from me. I also consider the time difference between myself and my company, and ensure that I completed my tasks as any delay from my side will affect my colleague’s workload. Even after completing my contract with them, I offered to assist remotely until they delegate my tasks to another person. The consequence of my action is maintaining a good relationship with my former employer and some colleagues that I also considered my friends.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-box">Cultural Influence</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">Culture has a huge influence in defining Filipino values and identity. It shapes us while we are growing and for most of us, we adapt it even after moving out from our own home countries. In Philippines, one of the values we uphold is being family oriented. Filipino children usually stay with their parents until they get their own family. Likewise, parents usually stay with one of their children when they get old. We are also very close with our extended family - from first cousin, second cousin, third aunt, etc. For me, being kind, having empathy, showing responsibility, and building trust creates a deeper connection and stronger bond between me, my family, and my extended family.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-box">Strengths</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">Perseverance, Reliable</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Limitation</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">I feel the need to improve my confidence in this new path that I'm taking.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">My experience working with resistance and tension</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">Tension and resistance are common issues in work place and in my experience in the past, I encountered it during the time where we have deadlines and the work depends on several team members. There were times that delay from one or two persons affect the overall outcome hence creating the tension. For me, I did not let myself be affected by the conflict, but instead I normally try to settle the issue with my colleague privately by listening to my coworker’s concern, understanding the situation, and thinking before speaking. In my opinion it helps build a friendly or amicable relationship and helps set aside differences that creates the tension so everyone could work towards what the company expect from us.</p>
