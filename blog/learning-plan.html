                <h2 class="h2-box">Long Term Goal</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  <strong>I am looking forward to further develop my problem solving skills especially in understanding the tasks and requirements of the challenges/projects. The impact that I would like to leave is someone who has determination to improve and grow despite the challenges. My destination in mind remains the same which is working for projects remotely.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  My goal is to complete this course, be a web developer, enter the IT market and explore this industry. But I would like to have something that is flexible or remote as I enjoyed being a stay at home mom. Also, in future I would like to travel more and it would be nice if I can travel and work remotely at the same time.

                <h2 class="h2-box">Strengths and Limitation</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  <strong>My strength would be my determination to learn and finish the bootcamp. My limitation would be my need to improve my confidence and to feel less intimidated.</strong>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Non-technical Challenge at Bootcamp</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  <strong>I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be speaking in front of a group. I know I am not very good in public speaking as I get nervous, stutter and tends to forget what I would say next, but if it's a small group, I think I would be able to manage it. Another non-technical challenge for me would be our movement to new place as I am yet to identify how it will affect my time during the bootcamp but will try my best to sort it out with the help of my husband.</strong>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Non-technical skills that I would like to develop while at DevAcademy</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  I would like to improve my confidence as this is new path for me. <strong>In addition, I would also like to further develop my communication skills.</strong>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Commitment to this Programme</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  I took the online class as it is convenient for me location wise and being a mom of 3. During the lockdown, it is little bit challenging as kids are home and needed to be guided in home-schooling. But since they are back at school, I could go back to my original plan which is to study during day time without interruptions, and I can also continue at night to practice coding. I also took time to get an overview of the succeeding lessons so I can plan my workload.

                <h2 class="h2-box">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  What I usually do is take a short break as it is not productive if I continue straining myself from work. Maybe take a fresh air outside my home or eat something, call my husband, play with the kids, or chat non-curriculum topic with my classmates or friends. Just anything to temporarily divert my attention and refresh my mind so I can refocus when I come back to my tasks.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way and expectation of myself on Bootcamp</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  <strong>Prior to starting the bootcamp, I expect that I would be able to review what I learned during the Foundations. My time commitment would be as per the same schedule that was given to us except for the block out time that I may need to enroll my children in new school when we arrive to our new place (but will try my best to sort it out and avoid block out time). In case it can't be avoided, I will ensure that I will catch up for the missed time. I am also committed to continue my work after the class hours for the next 9 weeks. Regarding seeking help in timely manner, I'll continue how I did it in Foundations but may need more technical support from the bootcamp team.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  First, if time permit, I will search for answers by revisiting the curriculum. Next is checking in slack with the team or contacting my facilitator directly. But if no one is immediately available, I can use google to search for what I need.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Expectation from the facilitation team and Bootcamp team</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  <strong>For the bootcamp team, I expect that they would be supportive towards the students. I thought that foundation challenges were already intensed but I anticipate that bootcamp will be more than that. Also, in the foundation course, my facilitator was supportive especially in mental aspects which encourages me and helped me feel at ease with my dilemma. I wish that the next bootcamp team would also be encouraging as the foundation's team.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  My expectation for the facilitation team is their support to the students especially for problems that can’t be answered by students. Also, an advise (technical and non-technical that is not part of the curriculum) from them would be nice as this will encourage the students. I’m not sure if every students are willing to hear constructive criticism, but for me, I welcome them as long as it will help strengthen my skills on this course.

                <h2 class="h2-box">Block-out time</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">
                  I made myself available with no block out times before joining the course, but unexpectedly, we are moving from Tauranga to Christchurch. I can give a clear picture if I need a block-out time once we arrive in Christchurch.
