                <h2 class="h2-box">Long Term Goal</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">My goal is to complete this course, be a web developer, enter the IT market and explore this industry. But I would like to have something that is flexible or remote as I enjoyed being a stay at home mom. Also, in future I would like to travel more and it would be nice if I can travel and work remotely at the same time.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Non-technical skills that I would like to develop while at DevAcademy</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">I would like to improve my confidence as this is new path for me.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Commitment to this Programme</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">I took the online class as it is convenient for me location wise and being a mom of 3. During the lockdown, it is little bit challenging as kids are home and needed to be guided in home-schooling. But since they are back at school, I could go back to my original plan which is to study during day time without interruptions, and I can also continue at night to practice coding. I also took time to get an overview of the succeeding lessons so I can plan my workload.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">What I usually do is take a short break as it is not productive if I continue straining myself from work. Maybe take a fresh air outside my home or eat something, call my husband, play with the kids, or chat non-curriculum topic with my classmates or friends. Just anything to temporarily divert my attention and refresh my mind so I can refocus when I come back to my tasks.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">First, if time permit, I will search for answers by revisiting the curriculum. Next is checking in slack with the team or contacting my facilitator directly. But if no one is immediately available, I can use google to search for what I need.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Expectation from the facilitation team</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">My expectation for the facilitation team is their support to the students especially for problems that can’t be answered by students. Also, an advise (technical and non-technical that is not part of the curriculum) from them would be nice as this will encourage the students. I’m not sure if every students are willing to hear constructive criticism, but for me, I welcome them as long as it will help strengthen my skills on this course.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Block-out time</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">I made myself available with no block out times before joining the course, but unexpectedly, we are moving from Tauranga to Christchurch. I can give a clear picture if I need a block-out time once we arrive in Christchurch (3 weeks from now).</p>
