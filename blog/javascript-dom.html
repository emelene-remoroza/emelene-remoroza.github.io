                <h2 class="h2-box">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">These are the three main languages use to build a website. HTML is a markup language, while CSS is a styling language, and JavaScript is a programming language. These three forms an integral part of how a website will be structured, presented, and behave. HTML provides the basic structure of the web page. This is the starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to make a website.  CSS provides the styling of the web page, giving the design such as background colors, position, etc., by assigning HTML elements on how the web page should appear. JavaScript provides the interactive elements and the dynamic behavior of the web page.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Control Flow and Loops</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">Control flow is about the order in which the code run and provide the program the ability to respond to changing conditions by executing code based on a condition. Loops allow to perform repetitive tasks until a certain condition is met. Example is whenever we go for a drive, kids will keep asking “are we there yet” every five minutes and will keep checking until we reach our destination where the loop stops.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that represents how HTML documents are read by the browser. <em>"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."</em> When a web page is loaded, the browser will create the DOM of the web page. The DOM allows JavaScript to manipulate, structure, and style a web page. Developer tools built in browsers such as Chrome DevTools allow the web developer to manipulate the DOM. With DevTools you can view, inspect, modify, debug and know what errors exist on a web page.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Arrays and Objects</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. It consists of an ordered list containing zero or more data types, and use numbered indices starting from 0 to access specific items. Arrays are very useful as they store multiple values in a single variable, which can condense and organize codes making it more readable and maintainable. Arrays can contain any data type including numbers, strings, and objects. Object on the other hand is a collection of related data or functionality. A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Functions</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. They are useful as the function allows us to define and structure a block of code, give it a name, and helps us make the code reusable.</p>
