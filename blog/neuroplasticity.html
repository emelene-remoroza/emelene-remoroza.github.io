        <p class="p1-box">
          Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to modify or reorganize itself and function throughout life. It allows the nerve cells or neurons in the brain to accommodate changes in relation to new situation or changes in the environment. Neuroplasticity in adult brain happens below conscious awareness. It requires extra effort and specific circumstances in order to harness and guide neuroplasticity in adult brain and science has proven that it is possible to access neuroplasticity in order to change your brain intentionally.

        <p class="p1-box">
          Here is the summary of writer Debbie Hampton in regards to the 10 core principles necessary for the remodelling of brain to take place from the book of Dr. Michael Merzenich <em>”Soft-Wired: How the New Science of Brain Plasticity Can Change Your Life”</em>:
        </p>
        <ol class="p1-box", style="margin-left:50px; text-align:justify;">
          <li><strong>Change is mostly limited to those situations in which the brain is in the mood for it.</strong> - If you are alert, on the ball, engaged, motivated, ready for action, the brain releases the neurochemicals necessary to enable brain change. When disengaged, inattentive, distracted, or doing something without thinking that requires no real effort, your neuroplastic switches are “off.”</li>
          <li><strong>The harder you try, the more you’re motivated, the more alert you are, and the better (or worse)  the potential outcome, the bigger the brain change.</strong> - If you’re intensely focused on the task and really trying to master something for an important reason, the change experienced will be greater.</li>
          <li><strong>What actually changes in the brain are the strengths of the connections of neurons that are engaged together, moment by moment, in time.</strong> - The more something is practiced, the more connections are changed and made to include all elements of the experience (sensory info, movement, cognitive patterns). You can think of it like a “master controller” being formed for that particular behavior which allows it to be performed with remarkable facility and reliability over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning-driven changes in connections increase cell-to-cell cooperation which is crucial for increasing reliability.</strong> - Merzenich explains this by asking you to imagine the sound of a football stadium full of fans all clapping at random versus the same people clapping in unison. He explains, “The more powerfully coordinated your [nerve cell] teams are, the more powerful and more reliable their behavioral productions.”</li>
          <li><strong>The brain also strengthens its connections between teams of neurons representing separate moments of successive things that reliably occur in serial time.</strong> - This allows your brain to predict what happens next and have a continuous “associative flow.” Without this ability, your stream of consciousness would be reduced to “a series of separate, stagnating puddles,” explains Merzenich.</li>
          <li><strong>Initial changes are temporary.</strong> - Your brain first records the change, then determines whether it should make the change permanent or not. It only becomes permanent if your brain judges the experience to be fascinating or novel enough or if the behavioral outcome is important, good or bad.</li>
          <li><strong>The brain is changed by internal mental rehearsal in the same ways and involving precisely the same processes that control changes achieved through interactions with the external world.</strong> - According to Merzenich, “You don’t have to move an inch to drive positive plastic change in your brain. Your internal representations of things recalled from memory work just fine for progressive brain plasticity-based learning.”</li>
          <li><strong>Memory guides and controls most learning.</strong> - As you learn a new skill, your brain takes note of and remembers the good attempts, while discarding the not-so-good trys. Then, it recalls the last good pass, makes incremental adjustments, and progressively improves.</li>
          <li><strong>Every movement of learning provides a moment of opportunity for the brain to stabilize – and reduce the disruptive power of – potentially interfering backgrounds or “noise.”</strong> - Each time your brain strengthens a connection to advance your mastery of a skill, it also weakens other connections of neurons that weren’t used at that precise moment. This negative plastic brain change erases some of the irrelevant or interfering activity in the brain.</li>
          <li><strong>Brain plasticity is a two-way street; it is just as easy to generate negative changes as it is positive ones.</strong> - You have a “use it or lose it” brain. It’s almost as easy to drive changes that impair memory and physical and mental abilities as it is to improve these things. Merzenich says that older people are absolute masters at encouraging plastic brain change in the wrong direction.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p1-box">
          There are other recommended ways in order for us to promote neuroplasticity which are basically almost anything that introduces us to something new, encourage learning, and get our brain out of comfort zone such as intermittent fasting, traveling, learning to play a musical instrument, reading fiction, playing video games, sleep, learning a new language, exercise, psychoactive substances, and reducing stress.

          There are lots of resources available regarding neuroplasticity but I found the website from Debbie Hampton interesting:

        <h2 class="h2-box">Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p class="p1-box">
          Having a growth mindset means you believe that you can improve and develop your skills with effort and hard work. You also like the part of learning process including making mistakes to correcting them and learning from them. You also embrace challenges as means to grow and develop new skills.

          <strong>Characteristics of Growth Mindset:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="p1-box", style="margin-left:50px; text-align:justify;">
          <li>Talents, abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and practice</li>
          <li>Engage deeply and process the error with a desire to correct the error</li>
          <li>Embrace challenges</li>
          <li>Persevere in the face of failures and setbacks </li>
          <li>Find inspiration in others success</li>
          <li>Accept criticism as a way to learn </li>
          <li>Embrace novelty with a desire to master new skills </li>
          <li>Look for people who challenge them to grow</li>
          <li>Focus on the process and learning without worrying about the outcome</li>
          <li>Leads to collaboration and innovation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2-box">Influence of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset on my Learning Plan</h2>
        <p class="p1-box">
          After researching about neuroplasticity and growth mindset, the influence it has towards my own learning plan is my understanding and assurance that I can improve and increase my knowledge on web development. Since this field is really new to me, I think my passion to learn and determination will help me achieve my goal. Also, through my efforts and mental exercise with the given challenges, it will help cultivate my brain’s growth in this particular area (web development).
