                <h2 class="h2-box">Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify and manage your own emotions as well as understanding and responding to other’s emotions. According to the American psychologist Daniel Goleman, who helped to popularize emotional intelligence, there are five key elements to EQ:</p>
                <ul class="p1-box", style="margin-left:50px; text-align:justify">
                    <li><strong>Self Awareness</strong> - the ability to recognize your own emotions and realize how it affects you and those around you. You have the self confidence and awareness of your own strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self Regulation</strong> - the ability to control and manage impulsive emotion and the ability to express it appropriately. You have the flexibility in your emotional response and can adapt to changing environments, like resisting impulsive emotions in a critical situation or helping yourself out when you’re feeling down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Motivation</strong> - the ability to initiate and commit to your inner needs and goals. You have your personal drive and optimistic in achieving what you are passionate about.</li>
                    <li><strong>Empathy</strong> - the ability to put yourself in someone else’s position, and the ability to recognize, understand, and respond to the feelings of others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Skills</strong> - the ability to interact and build positive relationships with others. This also includes how you effectively influence other people’s emotion.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Difference between Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) </h2>
                <p class="p1-box">IQ is the ability to use logic in solving problems and is used as an indicator to test cognitive abilities. EQ on the other hand measures the ability to manage emotions in yourself and towards others.  Both IQ and EQ are important and plays a role in influencing a person’s life, as IQ focuses on cognitive abilities and EQ focuses on emotional and social skills.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2-box">Importance of EQ</h2>
                <p class="p1-box">Emotional intelligence is important because it helps us build meaningful relationships within ourselves and with the people around us. EQ is also important in various aspects of our lives, be it personal or professional goals, as it helps us connect our emotions into actions. Recognizing our own feelings and learning to control them can help us overcome difficulties and help build healthier relationships.</p>
