        <h2 class="h2-box">Things I've Learned About Myself</h2>
        <p class="p1-box">
          I learned that I have the ability to learn new things and my passion to learn and determination will help me achieve my goal. Also, through my efforts and mental exercise with the given challenges, it will help cultivate my brain’s growth in areas that I am interested to learn.
          I learned that mindfulness helps me regulate my emotions and decrease my anxiety and I think it will help improve my well being should I decide to commit time doing mindfulness.
          I learned the importance of emotional intelligence and how recognizing my own feelings and learning to control them can help me overcome difficulties and also help build healthier relationships.

        <h2 class="h2-box">Role of Values, Empathy and Self Awareness in Learning and Programming?</h2>
        <p class="p1-box">
          Our values help us by giving positive direction in making decisions in difficult situations. Empathy helps us to be considerate with others. With the foundation course, fellow students and facilitators showed empathy with each other and there is ‘sharing is caring’ that applies where we can feel that we are growing together in this journey. Self awareness on the other hand helps us to be considerate with ourselves by doing our best without compromising our well being.

        <h2 class="h2-box">What Surprised Me About Core Learning</h2>
        <p class="p1-box">
          The topics given to us were interesting for me and I already noted that I would explore and read more about it after the bootcamp.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2-box">Challenging Aspect of Core Learning</h2>
        <p class="p1-box">
          I found writing personal blog is a challenge for me as I knew it is not my expertise and I am not used to writing something like this.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2-box">Why do you think a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course</h2>
        <p class="p1-box">
          Because you want us, your students, improve and develop our human skills aside from the technical skills since it plays an important role when we finish the bootcamp and get to the real world of web development.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2-box">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p class="p1-box">
          I don’t feel it’s a waste of time since it was interesting to know how these core subjects will help us eventually in our pursuit to achieving our technical goals. Also the topics were engaging like the eq, mindfulness, and neuroplasticity. The core subjects also help me to have a break from coding. But I do feel that the time to explore it is quite short and the time I spent thinking what to write in my blog is a bit time consuming since I am not really good in expressing my thoughts and not used to sharing it publicly. But overall, the core was a good part of the foundation course.
