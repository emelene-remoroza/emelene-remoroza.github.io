          Effective problem solving doesn’t mean coming up with an immediate solution. In such circumstances, you would likely find yourself acting on the first thought that comes to your mind, which isn't always the best solution. Taking the best approach to solve a problem should be seen as a process with several steps. There are different techniques that can be used to solve a problem such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="p1-box", style="margin-left:50px; text-align:justify;">
          <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong> - an informal way of programming description that does not require any strict programming language. It is used for creating an outline or a rough draft of a program.</li>
          <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - Rubber duck debugging can help sort out a coding problem because it forces you to talk through all of your choices and actions so far to an object hopefully to show you where you may have made a mistake.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong> - a sign that enables us to spot our mistake and resolve a problem.</li>
          <li><strong>Console.logging</strong> - used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed.</li>
          <li><strong>Google</strong> - very useful in searching for information, resources, or help.</li>
          <li><strong>Trying Something</strong> - basic method of learning that requires multiple attempts and patience to solve a problem.</li>
          <li><strong>Asking your peers and coaches for help</strong> - increases knowledge by sharing.</li>
          <li><strong>Improving with reflection</strong> - reflecting lets you evaluate your effectiveness instead of doing things as usual. It helps you identify in positive manner what you do, why you do, and how you can be more efficient in the future.</li>
        </ul>

          This sprint was really a challenge for me as we did several JavaScript exercises using the concept of kata in order to practice our coding and problem-solving skills. It was challenging as I am not very confident with my JS skills and time is also a factor, but it was a good test and pushed me to try my best to complete the exercise.

          I encountered some technical and non-technical problems that caused me to get blocked even in the simplest exercise, but after completing it, I felt relieved that I overcome those problems. First, as I mentioned, I am not confident and there’s a doubt while doing the challenges that I would not get it correctly. But the exercise and the hours I spent in this kata help me slowly reassure myself that I can continue this bootcamp. Regarding the technical problems, my usual mistakes were from my variable and function names, confusion on the exercise, and over analyzing. There were various techniques recommended to us to solve problems and I found that combination of some techniques was useful for me. Pseudocode helps me break down my approach. Reading error message, trying something, and console logging helps me figure out solution and spot my mistakes. Google was very helpful in searching for possible explanations, especially when I was confused. And asking help from peers and checking the slack foundation was encouraging. My first kata experience was really challenging, but the experience, especially on how you will solve the problem, made me feel that I am slowly building my confidence in web development.
